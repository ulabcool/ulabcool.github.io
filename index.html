    <h1>ULab</h1>
    <p>Usabilla Lab is an event that happens once per month. It started on the premise that everyone has great ideas, but they're cheap and useless if they don't turn into actions. The ULab is the place where ideas come to life!
The event takes place the last Friday of every month and everyone with an idea is more than welcome to take part.
Have you ever thought of building a VR environment? Do you have an idea for a chat bot? Or are you interested in other AI developments? Do you want to understand how brains react to the input of the today's world through EEG reading? Ulab is the place to make all of this and more happen.
